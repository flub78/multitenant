# Localization

The application uses the [Laravel Localization mechanism](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/localization).

Initially "en" and "fr" will be provided, more to validate the implementation than to provide a real feature. Some of the parent project had support in Dutch but there is currently no immediate requirement except for French. 

Note that it is quite obvious that local should be configurable per tenant, [see configuration](configuration.md)
