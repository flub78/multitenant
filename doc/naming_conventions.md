# Naming conventions

In this project, naming conventions are important, not only to insure homogeneous naming but also to minimize surprises and to enforce the convention over configuration principle. This principle is heavily used by Ruby on rail. It implies that in most of the cases, reasonable default are provided and configuration has only to be used when the default is not acceptable. It make the programmer life easier as in most of the case, there is nothing to do.
